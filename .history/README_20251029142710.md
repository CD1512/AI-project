## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze customer sentiment and build an intelligent smartphone recommendation and advisory system based on product reviews from **The Gioi Di Dong**, one of Vietnam’s leading electronics retailers.

### Objectives
- Crawl and structure smartphone product and review data from The Gioi Di Dong.  
- Build a **sentiment analysis** model to classify customer opinions.  
- Create a **chatbot advisor** using LangChain + Flask to recommend suitable phones.  
- Implement **review summarization** using Transformer-based models.  
- Provide an interactive and explainable **recommendation system**.

## Data Description

**Source:** [https://www.thegioididong.com](https://www.thegioididong.com)

### Data to Collect
- Product name  
- Price and promotions  
- Technical specifications  
- Customer reviews (rating + text)  
- Product images (optional)

### Data Storage
- `raw_data/products.csv` — Product details  
- `raw_data/reviews.csv` — Customer reviews  
- `database/schema.sql` — PostgreSQL schema

## Technology Stack

| Stage | Tools / Technologies |
|--------|----------------------|
| Crawling | Scrapy / Selenium |
| ETL & Cleaning | Pandas, NumPy |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Modeling | TensorFlow / PyTorch (PhoBERT, BERT, LSTM) |
| Summarization | Transformer models (BART, T5, PhoBERT2Seq) |
| Chatbot | LangChain + Flask |
| Deployment | FastAPI + Docker |
| Visualization | Power BI / Matplotlib / Streamlit |

## Use Cases

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
Classify reviews into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiment using PhoBERT or LSTM-based models.

### 2. Comment Clustering
Identify themes and patterns in reviews (e.g., “battery”, “camera”, “price”) using K-Means or BERTopic.

### 3. Review Summarization 
Generate concise summaries of customer opinions:
> “Users love the battery life and display quality but complain about camera performance.”

Implemented via pre-trained Transformer summarization models such as **T5** or **BART** fine-tuned on Vietnamese reviews.

### 4. Chatbot Phone Advisor 
A conversational agent built with **LangChain + Flask** that recommends phones based on user queries:
> “Tôi có 10 triệu, muốn mua điện thoại chụp hình đẹp, pin khỏe.”

Pipeline:
1. LangChain interprets user intent and extracts constraints (budget, brand, features).  
2. Queries vectorized product database (pgvector / FAISS).  
3. Returns top recommended phones ranked by rating and sentiment.

### 5. Recommendation System 
Suggests best phone options based on **budget**, **brand**, and **customer feedback**.

| Method | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| Rule-based Filtering | Filter by brand + price + rating |
| ML-based Recommendation | Embedding-based similarity search using SentenceTransformers |
| Personalized (optional) | User-history based recommendation via Collaborative Filtering |
